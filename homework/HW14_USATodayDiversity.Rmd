## Overview

In this exercise, we will calculate the **USA TODAY Diversity Index** for Maryland cities with a population of at least 10,000 using 2020 Census race and ethnicity data. The Diversity Index reflects the probability that two randomly selected individuals from a city are of different races or ethnicities.

A score of 0 indicates no diversity (everyone is the same race/ethnicity), while a score closer to 100 indicates higher diversity. The **most diverse city** has the highest index, reflecting a balanced mix of several racial and ethnic groups. The **least diverse** city likely has one overwhelmingly dominant racial/ethnic group.

## Task 1: Load and Describe the Data (3 points)

Run the following code to load the data, then examine it and describe what it contains. Based on the raw numbers alone, which cities stand out as diverse to you?

The dataset contains the name of the city, its total population and the number of people who identify as each race option on the census, as well as those who identify as Hispanic and not Hispanic. At first glance, the following cities stand out as diverse: Baltimore City, Columbia, Germantown and Silver Spring.

```{r load-data}
md_cities <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/usat_diversity_index.csv")

## Task 2: Calculate Race Percentages

```{r race-percentages}
md_cities <- md_cities |>
  mutate(
    White_pct = White / TotalPop,
    Black_pct = Black / TotalPop,
    Native_pct = Native / TotalPop,
    Asian_pct = Asian / TotalPop,
    NHPI_pct = NHPI / TotalPop
  )
```

## Task 3: Square the Race Percentages

We need to square the race percentages in order to calculate the probability that any two people chosen at random from a given census area are of different races or are Hispanic or not.

```{r square-race}
md_cities <- md_cities |>
  mutate(
    White_pct_sq = White_pct^2,
    Black_pct_sq = Black_pct^2,
    Native_pct_sq = Native_pct^2,
    Asian_pct_sq = Asian_pct^2,
    NHPI_pct_sq = NHPI_pct^2
  )
```


## Task 4: Calculate Race Probabilities (3 points)

The race probability is the sum the squared probabilities for each of the races. It represents the probability that two people randomly chosen from the same city will be of the same race. Which city has the highest race probability, and why do you think that is?

The city with the highest race probability is Summerfield. I think it has the highest race probability because about 93% of its population is Black, so most people in the city are of the same race. 

```{r race-prob}
md_cities <- md_cities |>
  mutate(
    Race_Prob = White_pct_sq + Black_pct_sq + Native_pct_sq + Asian_pct_sq + NHPI_pct_sq
  ) |> 
  arrange(desc(Race_Prob))

View(md_cities)
```


## Task 5: Calculate Ethnicity Percentages and Their Squares (3 points)

Hispanic origin is not a race but an ethnicity or nationality â€“ and a separate Census question. The probability someone is Hispanic or not Hispanic must be calculated separately from race, and Hisp_Prob is the probability that two randomly selected people will be Hispanic or not. That's an important distinction, because unlike race probability, this measures the likelihood of a binary question: that both random people will be Hispanic. What do you notice about the cities with the *lowest* Hisp_Prob scores?

The cities with the lowest Hisp_Prob scores tend to be fairly split between people who are Hispanic and people who are not Hispanic. However, all but one of the 10 cities with the lowest Hisp_Prob scores have more non-Hispanic people than Hispanic people. 

```{r ethnicity}
md_cities <- md_cities |>
  mutate(
    HispTotal = HISPANIC + NotHispanic,
    Hisp_pct = HISPANIC / HispTotal,
    NotHisp_pct = NotHispanic / HispTotal,
    Hisp_pct_sq = Hisp_pct^2,
    NotHisp_pct_sq = NotHisp_pct^2,
    Hisp_Prob = Hisp_pct_sq + NotHisp_pct_sq
  ) |> 
  arrange(Hisp_Prob)

View(md_cities)
```

## Task 6: Multiply Race and Ethnicity Probabilities

Here we multiply the two probabilities together to get the probability that any two random people have the SAME race and ethnicity.

```{r combined-prob}
md_cities <- md_cities |>
  mutate(
    RaceEth_Prob = Race_Prob * Hisp_Prob
  )
```


## Task 7: Calculate Diversity Index (3 points)

The final step is to calculate the probability that two people randomly chosen WILL NOT BE OF THE SAME RACE OR ETHNICITY. In other words, the highest index scores will be cities where those two random people will be from different backgrounds. Put simply, more diverse. Which cities are the top 3, and where are they located? Look at the bottom of the list - which city is the least diverse, and where is it?

The top three most diverse cities are Langley Park, Wheaton and Adelphi. Langley Park and Adelphi are in Prince George's County (and not that far from College Park) and Wheaton is in Montgomery county. The three least diverse cities are Lake Shore, Lake Arbor and Largo. Lake Arbor and Largo are also in Prince George's county, while Lake Shore is in Anne Arundel County. 

```{r diversity-index}
md_cities <- md_cities |>
  mutate(
    Diversity_Index = (1 - RaceEth_Prob) * 100
  ) |> 
  arrange(desc(Diversity_Index))

View(md_cities)
```

### Pitch a story (8 points)

Given the data that you've produced here, write a headline and lede of the most interesting story from this exercise, and add below that details on how you would report it out: who you'd talk to and the questions you'd ask. When you describe the Diversity Index values, do so in a similar way to how USA Today did; the raw values themselves won't mean much to readers.

Headline: Diversity and uniformity: How Prince George's County has both

Lead:
Prince George's County is home to some of the most and least diverse cities in Maryland, an analysis found.

The USA Today diversity index found that Langley Park and Adelphi are among the top three most diverse cities in the state, while Lake Arbor and Largo are two of the least diverse. The index measures how likely it is for two people from the same area to be of a different race or ethnicity.

Reporting strategy: To report this story, I would want to talk with experts in human geography and urban planning. I would ask them how one county can be home to very diverse and very non-diverse cities at the same time and what policies or actions have resulted in this. I would also want to talk to someone in the county government to get their perspective on how and why this is, and if there are any current policies that are incentivising this. Lastly, I would want to hear from the people who live in each of these cities to see how (or if) they notice the diversity or non-diversity in their cities.
