title: "HW4 MD CityCrime"
---

In this assignment, we will be working with a dataset of total crimes reported by Maryland cities for two consecutive years. You'll load the data, calculate the violent and property crime rates for each city for both years, and then calculate the percentage change in the crime rates between the two years. You'll also write a short story based on your findings.

### Task 1: Load the Tidyverse and Janitor

You will need to load the tidyverse library and the janitor library

```{r}
library(tidyverse, janitor)
```

Then you'll load the data from the web. The URL for the data is: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/md_cities_crime_2019_2020.csv. You will create a dataframe called `md_cities` that contains the data from this URL.

### Task 2: Load the Data

```{r}
md_cities <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/md_cities_crime_2019_2020.csv")
```
### Task 3: Calculating Rates

Calculate violent and property crime rates for each city for both years using `mutate()`. You'll create four new columns: `violent_rate_2019`, `property_rate_2019`, `violent_rate_2020`, and `property_rate_2020`. You'll need to figure out the proper unit rate, given that there are varying populations. There's no perfect choice; choose the one that works best for you. Save the results to a new dataframe called `md_cities_rates`.

```{r}
md_cities_rates <- md_cities %>% mutate(
  violent_rate_2019 = violent2019/pop2019 * 10000,
  property_rate_2019 = property2019/pop2019 * 10000,
  violent_rate_2020 = violent2020/pop2020 * 10000,
  property_rate_2020 = property2020/pop2020 * 10000,
)
```

### Task 4: Describe the Rates

Examine the new dataframe, `md_cities_rates`, by clicking on it in the Environment tab in RStudio and sorting by the rate columns. Write a couple of sentences about the results, comparing and contrasting the cities with the highest rates (both violent and property) in 2019 and 2020. Do you see any patterns? What does this tell you about crime in Maryland cities? What's the story here?

Overall, Ocean City seems to have had the highest rate of both property and violent crimes in 2019 and 2020. While Baltimore is a close second in violent crime rates, it is nowhere Ocean City when it comes to property crime rate. It is interesting to note, and potentially newsworthy, that in 2020, Baltimore had more reported violent crimes than Ocean City -- in fact it had the most out of all the cities in the data set -- however, Ocean City had the higher violent crime rate that year. 


### Task 5: Calculate Percentage Change

Let's add two percentage change columns to your dataframe: one for violent crime rates and one for property crime rates. You'll calculate the percentage change between 2019 and 2020 for each city. Save the results to a new dataframe called `md_cities_change`.

```{r}
md_cities_change <- md_cities_rates %>% mutate(
  pct_change_violent = (violent_rate_2020 - violent_rate_2019)/violent_rate_2019 * 100,
  pct_change_property = (property_rate_2020 - property_rate_2019)/property_rate_2019 * 100
)
```

### Task 7: Describe Percentage Changes

Look at the `md_cities_change` dataframe by clicking on it in the Environment tab in RStudio. Write a couple of sentences describing the percentage change results. What's more interesting here, the patterns or the outliers? What's the story in the data?

I think both the patterns and the outliers are interested, though this data does have a pretty significant outliers. The rate of violent crime in Edmonston in PG County increased by just under 900% from 2019 to 2020. While that sounds like a lot, it's not. In 2019 Edmoston had 1 reported incident of a violent crime, but in 2020, they had 10. Its a significant difference, but put into context, its not that much. 

### Task 8: Tell the Best Story

Write up a lede and nutgraf of a story with the _best_ story idea you've found in this assignment. The lede should be a single sentence that summarizes the most important information in the data. The nutgraf should be a paragraph that provides more context and explains why the data is important.

Ocean City had the highest violent crime rate of Maryland cities in 2020, according to crime data.

In 2020, Ocean City had a violent crime rate of about 240. Right behind it was Baltimore City, which had a violent crime rate of about 160. While Ocean City had the higher crime rate out of the two cities, Baltimore had the higher number of reported incidents of violent crime. Baltimore had 9,402 reported incidents of violent crime, while Ocean City had 166.


### Task 9: Save Your Work and Put it on GitHub

Save this notebook, then commit it to your local repository. Push the changes to your GitHub repository and submit the URL for this file in ELMS.

### Task 10: (Homework 5)

Your task will be to take the violent crime rates for 2020 and do three things:

10A - Using the 2020 violent crime rate, calculate the percentiles using `ntile()`. Save the results to a new dataframe called `md_cities_percentiles`. How many cities are above the 90th percentile?

```{r}
md_cities_percentiles <- md_cities_change %>% mutate(percentile_V_2020 = ntile(violent_rate_2020, 100))
```

There are 10 cities above the 90th percentile. 


10B - Calculate the Interquartile Range of the 2020 violent crime rate using `summarize()` and R's `IQR()` function. The syntax is similar to how `mean()` works.

```{r}
md_cities_percentiles %>%
  summarize(IQR_V_2020 = IQR(violent_rate_2020))
```



10C - Do the results change your best story idea from the previous assignment? Why or why not?
 
For reference, the IQR I calculated was 41.98895. 

I would say this result does not change my best story idea from homework 4. While I'm not sure what a "typical" IQR for this type of data looks like, I'm not surprised that there are about 41 different values in the middle 50% of the data. Violent crime rates change from place to place, so I would think it would be natural (and not very newsworthy) to have a little bit of spread in the middle values of the data.
